# System Development
Variations of the flow through the water quality system being developed.

## Keowee
A flow-through water quality monitoring system that measures PH, TDS, Water Temperature, and ambient Temperature.

## Moultrie
A flow-through water quality monitoring system that integrated nuclear magnetic resonance monitoring as well as measuring PH, TDS, Water Temperature, and ambient Temperature.

##Prototyping_24
A prototype project beginning work in May of 2024 to combine a flowthrough NMR, a water quality, and a water height monitoring system.
